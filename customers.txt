Beautiful World, Where Are You*Irish author Sally Rooney wins this year’s Best Fiction award for her celebrated novel on the complexities of romance, sex, and friendship on our swiftly tilting planet.

The last thing he told me*Laura Dave wins this year’s Mystery & Thriller award for The Last Thing He Told Me, in which a mother and her stepdaughter try to unwind a lethally knotted secret.

Project Hail Mary*Engineer-turned-novelist Andy Weir is on a crazy run. Best career switch ever? Project Hail Mary—concerning a resourceful astronaut and an extinction-level event—is Weir’s third nomination…and his third win. As with his previous books The Martian and Artemis, Project Hail Mary is final evidence that old-school hard science fiction is back. Quantum physics! Chemistry! Exobiology! Aerodynamics! It actually is rocket science.*6thbook.jpg*Andy Weir*
The final girl support group*Author Grady Hendrix has carved out his own unique domain in horror by playing around with the genre’s blurry edges and recurring tropes.

Hendrix’s open question: What if some of these women got together?*7thbook.jpg*Grady Hendrix*
Broken*Impossibly funny and beautifully empathetic, Jenny Lawson’s writing works like medicine. It makes you feel better. With Broken, Lawson brings her delightful style of deliberate lateral thinking to a new batch of topics: marriage, lizards, dentists, experimental transcranial magnetic stimulation—you know, that sort of thing. A case can be made that Broken is, quite literally, the feel-good book of the year.*8thbook.jpg*Jenny Lawson*
The anthropocene reviewed*Adapted from his acclaimed podcast series, John Green’s uniquely structured collection of essays combines history, science, and memoir to create a new kind of nonfiction approach—brainy and compelling.

This is Green’s second GCA win, his first was in 2012 for The Fault in Our Stars.*9thbook.jpg*John Green*
